                <h1>Concept</h1>
                <p>Introducing Mono, a lightweight, ultra high performance, road legal supercar designed and manufactured
                    using the latest racing technology. Aimed at drivers who seek a purist driving experience and for whom
                    design, engineering excellence and performance are of paramount importance, Mono is an aggressive
                    design and will set a new benchmark in the small, but elite segment of radical, lightweight sports
                    cars.</p>

                <h1>Design</h1>
                <p>The single central-seat gave our designers and project engineers the ultimate blank canvas on which to
                    assemble their dream. The organic, enclosed front and exposed mechanical rear typifies the unique
                    appearance of Mono. The design aesthetic is intended to combine sculpted, sleek, organic forms to
                    provide an emotional, human connection juxtaposing the technical, mechanical elements of the car.</p>
                <p>While this vision runs throughout Mono's appearance it was fundamental to our designers that form follow
                    function on all aspects of the car. The necessity to gain access to the central driving position and
                    adjustable dampers as well as providing clean airflow to the radiators and engine are just some of the
                    factors on which Mono's architecture is built.</p>
